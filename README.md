## Instructions
The first challenge requires a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100 and should output the correct grade.
In the second challenge, the program required takes as input the speed of a car, and gives output as OK or gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points if speed requirements are not met.
 The final challenge requires a program that calculates an individualâ€™s  PAYEE (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.

 To get started, create a repository on your GitHub account and copy the URL. 
 On your terminal, run the following commands;

git remote add origin https://github.com/ajowinga/Toy-Problems-Code-challenge-1.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

This will link the  existing repository into your local environment.
 Navigate into its directory in the terminal. Create a README.md file, gradeGenerator.js,speedGenerator.js and netSalaryCalculator.js.
 Run code . to open the files in Visual Studio Code. This is where you will code.

 Your solutions for all toy problems, should be written in javaScript.
 Run the code on an online compiler-progarmiz to check validity.
 Code should be properly documented by the use of comments. /* */

Use git add . and git commit to save your changes. Make as many commits -m "commit message " as you progress.
Use git push to push the changes up to the remote repo.
